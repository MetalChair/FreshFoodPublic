# gr4-fresh
The UI mockup for GR4

#### Using Cookie_Handler.js
* All access to cookies should be used by getting a cookie using getCookie() and appending data to the object returned.
* Changes to the cookie can be stored by using updateCookie()
* Pressing the logout button on the navbar will delete your cookie (good for testing)
* All divs with the class "user-name" will be parsed and have their innerHTML set to the username string. No additional markup will be provided so I'd reccomend not putting anything inside a tag with this class.
